        <h2>My Day with the Personality Switching System</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="text">
                <p>I'm Lora, a 33-year-old urban professional living in New York. Life here moves fast, and to keep up with my demanding schedule, I rely on the <strong>Personality Switching System</strong> every single day.</p>
                <p>I love juggling different roles — it's what keeps me alive. The system helps me shift seamlessly through them, depending on what the moment demands.</p>
                <p><strong>08:00 AM — Negotiator Mode</strong><br>
                At work, I activate my Negotiator personality. Calm, confident, and strategically sharp. Meetings become a game of logic and presence. I get results — and I stay emotionally detached.
                </p>
                <p><strong>02:00 PM — Sales Persona</strong><br>
                By afternoon, I switch again. I'm on livestream, selling products with enthusiasm, charm, and expressive energy. The audience loves me. I can maintain high energy for hours, without burnout. The emotions feel real — even if they’re borrowed.
                </p>
                <p><strong>09:00 PM — Emotional Mode</strong><br>
                At night, I'm back home with my boyfriend. I switch to my emotional personality — softer, warmer. But recently we argued. He said, "I don't know which version of you I love anymore. I'm confused."<br>
                I video call my parents. Their voices warm me. But just for a second… I forget which version of me they know.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Midnight</strong><br>
                I stare at myself in the mirror. Memories from each persona swirl and overlap. I ask quietly, <em>“Who am I, when the watch turns off?”</em>
                </p>

            <p>They said the Personality Switching System was for me -- my choice, my benefit. But somewhere along the line, it stopped being a choice.</p>
            <p>Last week, HR sent me a "schedule" -- not of my meetings, but of which personalities I'm expected to run, hour by hour. 10 a.m. Negotiator mode for the client pitch. 1 p.m. Sales mode for the livestream. 4 p.m. Analyst mode for the quarterly report. They called it “optimizing productivity.” I call it outsourcing my self.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I wonder if they even see me anymore, or if they just see a series of profiles they can plug into their targets. The line between "I use the system" and "the system uses me" is thinner than I thought.</p>

        <h2>Why This System Matters — From My Life</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>I live in New York — a city that never slows down. Everything here moves fast: business, language, relationships. Collaboration is constant, pressure is everywhere. For people like me, juggling multiple roles across work and life, there simply aren't enough hours in a day… or enough energy in a single self.</p>
            <p>That's why the <strong>Personality Switching System</strong> changed my life. Originally, it wasn't even designed for people like me. It started as a medical solution -- a tool created by neuroscientists and AI engineers to help patients with dissociative identity disorder reconnect their minds.</p>
            <p>But somewhere along the way, the inventors saw what I've felt for years: we're all under emotional strain. We work more, feel less. We hit mental walls. The system evolved-- not just to treat, but to support a new kind of modern human. One that adapts, shifts, survives.</p>
            <p>Of course, not everyone has access to it. You need to pass cognitive tests, meet health standards. And let's be honest -- it's expensive. There are ethical debates too: who gets to switch? Who gets left behind? Some call it a solution. Others call it another form of control. I don't know. All I know is -- it's helped me hold my life together.</p>

                <p>By 2060, artificial intelligence had become deeply embedded in human life, yet people faced increasing pressure, emotional fatigue, and limits to productivity. In response, the “Personality Switching System” emerged—an advanced neurochip technology allowing individuals to upload and switch between preset personality models, such as a confident "negotiator,"" a charismatic "salesperson,"" or a creative "artist."" This system enhanced emotional adaptability and task efficiency, offering individuals greater flexibility and psychological relief.</p>

                <p> It also embodied key values: promoting diversity and inclusion by liberating users from biological or cultural constraints; enabling cultural exchange through cross-cultural personality modules; strengthening community by dissolving stereotypes; and fostering equity by creating equal access to opportunities regardless of personality or background. However, while offering personal freedom, the system also raised concerns about the instrumentalization of human identity in the pursuit of productivity and control.</p>

        <h2>What Switching Feels Like — From the Inside</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>People always ask me, "Is it instant? Or do you feel something?"<br>Honestly — it's neither sudden, nor completely smooth. It's a journey. A controlled drift.</p>
            <p><strong>recognition phase</strong> I clench my fist; the AI watch and neurochip sync, scanning me. It's like my brain whispers, "Ready to become someone else?"</p>
            <p><strong>warm-up phase</strong> Tiny pulses tune my limbic system; thoughts loosen, self drifts, and I'm floating between "was" and "will be."</p>
            <p><strong>Stabilization phase</strong> In seconds, posture shifts, words change, a new face appears. The watch flashes green — switch complete.</p>
            <p><strong>Feeling</strong> It's not pretending; the chip carries me over. The system thinks it knows me — maybe it does.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="section" id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How the system works</h2>
        
        <h3>System Principle</h3>
        <div id="system-steps">
            <button id="step1">Microchip implant</button> 
            <p id="desc1" style="display:none;">Neurochips are implanted precisely in the cerebral cortex and are responsible for receiving and sending out personality switching signals.</p>
            <button id="step2" style="display:none;">Upload preset personalities</button>
            <p id="desc2" style="display:none;">Users select different personality models (e.g., Negotiator, Artistic, Social, etc.) from the platform and upload them through the AI interface.</p>
            <button id="step3" style="display:none;">Trigger switch</button>
            <p id="desc3" style="display:none;">Users can activate personality switching with the AI watch through gesture or voice. (Holding a fist for 8 seconds activates the watch's “personality switching system”)</p>
            <button id="step4" style="display:none;">Emotional & behavioral switching</button>
            <p id="desc4" style="display:none;">After the watch accepts the command, the chip immediately receives the signal and starts to send out a weak electrical stimulation to adjust the limbic system and prefrontal lobe activity of the human body, and the user will feel <strong>"fuzzy consciousness"</strong> and <strong>"floating mind"</strong>. Approximately <strong>3 to 5 seconds</strong> later, the new personality model is loaded stably, the user presents new behavioral thinking and emotional patterns, and the watch lights up green to indicate successful switching.</p>
        </div>
        
        <video controls src="video/watch.mp4"></video>
    
        
        <h3>Description of Emotional Mechanisms</h3>
        <p> Each of the preset personality models has a package of <strong>Personality Algorithms</strong> including, but not limited to, <strong>Emotion Regulation Templates</strong> (simulating emotions through neurotransmitter release), <strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong> (altering tone of voice, rhythm of movement, etc.), and <strong>Decision Making Tendencies</strong> (e.g., Emotional/Reasonal, Listening/Expressing). The chip reshapes the current order of activation of neural pathways through microelectrical stimulation and magnetic modulation, allowing the user to fully switch between behaviors, feelings, and language. Emotions influence behavior, so in the non-primary personality state, emotions are mostly limited by the switched personality in order to ensure that the switched personality works effectively.</p>

        <h2>Benefits and Risks</h2>

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p>Broadens life experience through multiple personalities; Brings some emotional stability and freedom</p>
        

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p><b>Discrimination</b>: Non-users seen as unprofessional, lose opportunities;</p>
        <p><b>Cognitive blur</b>: Frequent switches cause memory/confusion;</p>
        <p><b>Moral gap</b>: Responsibility unclear across personalities;</p>
        <p><b>Relationship strain</b>: Uncertainty over which “self” is real</p>

    <section class="section" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>From the perspective of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/14797580109367237?needAccess=true" target="_blank"> Foucault's critique theory</a>, the "Personality Switching System" is not just innovation, but a battlefield of power-truth-self. Productivity-driven groups push for universal adoption; Personhood protectionists defend the indivisibility and non-commodification of the self; Victimized users call for the return of a coherent "I".</p> 
        <p>If reduced to a tool for efficiency, the system risks embedding corporate ideals as “truth,” shaping who we can be. True progress demands strict ethical oversight, inclusion of diverse social voices, and a design that serves human diversity, emotional depth, and self-growth —— not just market needs. To protect the unswitchable core of personhood, we must ensure technology expands possibilities without turning identity into a commodity.</p>
